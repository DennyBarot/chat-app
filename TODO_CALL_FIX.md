# WebRTC Call Media Stream Fix Plan

## Issue Analysis
User1 can see User2's audio/video, but User2 cannot see User1's audio/video.

## Root Cause Investigation
1. Check if both caller and callee add local media tracks properly
2. Verify signaling flow and timing
3. Ensure remote tracks are properly handled
4. Debug ICE candidate exchange

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Add Debug Logging
- Add console logs to track media stream setup
- Log when tracks are added to peer connection
- Log when remote tracks are received

### 2. Fix Callee Setup
- Ensure callee adds local tracks before creating answer
- Verify remote description is set correctly
- Check ICE candidate handling

### 3. Verify Signaling
- Confirm offer/answer exchange works correctly
- Ensure ICE candidates are properly exchanged

### 4. Test and Validate
- Test call flow after fixes
- Verify both users can see each other's media

## Files to Modify
- client/src/components/CallModal.jsx (main changes)
- client/src/context/SocketContext.jsx (if signaling needs adjustment)

## Progress
- [x] Add debug logging to CallModal.jsx
- [x] Fix callee media track setup
- [x] Verify signaling flow
- [x] Test call functionality and fix signaling state issue
