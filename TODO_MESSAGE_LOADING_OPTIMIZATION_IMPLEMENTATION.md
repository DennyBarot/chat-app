# Message Loading Optimization Implementation Steps

## Tasks Completed âœ…

### 1. Client-Side Optimizations
- [x] Ensure proper loading states in MessageContainer.jsx
- [x] Implement skeleton screens during message loading
- [x] Optimize Redux state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [x] Add client-side message caching

### 2. Real-Time Improvements
- [x] Review WebSocket connection management
- [x] Implement client-side message caching strategy

### 3. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Measure loading times before optimizations
- [ ] Test with different message volumes
- [ ] Verify real-time message delivery performance

## Changes Made

### MessageContainer.jsx
- Replaced simple spinner with SkeletonMessageList for initial loading
- Improved loading more messages indicator with spinner and text
- Enhanced new message indicator to show count when multiple messages arrive

### message.slice.js
- Optimized Redux state updates using Set for faster duplicate checking
- Improved performance when adding new messages to existing state

### message.thunk.js
- Added client-side caching with 30-second expiration
- Implemented cache clearing function for specific conversations
- Reduced server requests by serving cached data when available

## Next Steps
- Test the application to measure performance improvements
- Monitor loading times and optimize further if needed
- Consider adding more aggressive caching strategies for frequently accessed conversations
