# Voice Message Optimization Plan

## Current Issues Identified:
1. Audio is sent as Base64 which is inefficient for large files
2. No direct playback - user must click play button
3. No visual feedback during audio loading
4. Potential latency in audio transmission

## Optimization Steps:

### Phase 1: Server-side Improvements
- [ ] Optimize audio handling to use streaming instead of Base64
- [ ] Implement efficient audio file storage and retrieval
- [ ] Add audio compression for faster transmission

### Phase 2: Client-side Improvements  
- [ ] Implement direct audio playback on message receive
- [ ] Add loading indicators for audio messages
- [ ] Optimize audio recording and processing
- [ ] Add visual feedback for audio status

### Phase 3: Real-time Enhancements
- [ ] Optimize socket events for audio messages
- [ ] Implement audio buffering and streaming
- [ ] Add progress indicators for audio upload/download

## Files to Modify:
1. server/controllers/message.controller.js
2. client/src/pages/home/SendMessage.jsx
3. client/src/pages/home/Message.jsx
4. client/src/store/slice/message/message.thunk.js
5. server/models/messageModel.js

## Current Progress:
- Analysis complete
- Plan created
- Starting implementation...
