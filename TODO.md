# Socket Error Fix - Progress Tracking

## Issue Identified
Error: "Cannot destructure property 'socket' of 'Pd(...)' as it is null."
Root Cause: Incorrect usage of `useSocket` hook - trying to destructure `{ socket }` when the hook returns the socket object directly.

## Files Fixed
- [x] `client/src/pages/home/MessageContainer.jsx` - Changed `const { socket } = useSocket();` to `const socket = useSocket();`
- [x] `client/src/pages/home/SendMessage.jsx` - Changed `const { socket } = useSocket();` to `const socket = useSocket();`

## Verification
- ✅ MessageContainer.jsx now correctly uses `const socket = useSocket();`
- ✅ SendMessage.jsx now correctly uses `const socket = useSocket();`
- ✅ Both files follow the same pattern as UserSidebar.jsx which was already correct

## Next Steps
- Test the application to ensure the socket error is resolved
- Verify socket functionality works correctly in both components
- Ensure real-time messaging features work as expected
